THE ODIN PROJECT: HTML/CSS PROJECT

Google Homepage (https://christian-ortega.github.io/google-homepage/)

This is a simple replica of the Google homepage.

This project emphasized three skills. The first was the implementation of various different HTML elements, such as links, images, and buttons; special attention was paid in setting up IDs and classes. The second was the styling and alignment of these elements using CSS, which included some dynamic functionality such as response to hovering. CSS Flexbox and Grid were also used to help with alignment. And, the third was responsive web design, through preserving the proper alignment and size of elements in response to window resizing.
